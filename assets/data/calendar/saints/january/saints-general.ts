    feast_day: "01-05",
    short_bio: "Redemptorist bishop of Philadelphia, promoter of Catholic education and first American male saint",
    biography: [
      "St. John Nepomucene Neumann was born on March 28, 1811, in Prachatitz, Bohemia (now Prachatice, Czech Republic). He was the third of six children in a devout Catholic family. His father worked as a stocking weaver, and John grew up speaking German and Czech. From an early age, he felt called to the priesthood and the missions.",
      "John studied at the seminary in Budweis and then at Charles University in Prague, where he excelled in theology and learned several languages, including English, French, Italian, Spanish, and eventually Gaelic. When he completed his seminary studies in 1835, he found that his diocese had an overabundance of priests and his ordination was postponed indefinitely.",
      "Learning of the great need for priests in America, particularly for German-speaking immigrants, John decided to emigrate. In 1836, at age 25, he arrived in New York with one suit of clothes and one dollar in his pocket. Bishop John Dubois ordained him just three weeks later at St. Patrick's Old Cathedral in New York City.",
      "Father Neumann spent his first four years as a missionary priest in the Niagara Falls area, ministering to scattered Catholic settlements. He walked miles through snow and wilderness to reach his far-flung parishioners. Despite the hardships, he found joy in bringing the sacraments to people who had been without them for years.",
      "Seeking community and structure, John joined the Redemptorists in 1840, becoming the first to profess vows in the Congregation of the Most Holy Redeemer in the United States. He served in Maryland and Pennsylvania, becoming known for his tireless work, simple lifestyle, and dedication to the poor and neglected.",
      "In 1852, to his great surprise and reluctance, John was appointed the fourth Bishop of Philadelphia by Pope Pius IX. As bishop, he faced a diocese with a large immigrant population, mounting debts, and anti-Catholic sentiment. Despite these challenges, he accomplished remarkable things during his eight-year episcopate.",
      "Bishop Neumann increased the number of Catholic schools in his diocese from two to over one hundred, established the first diocesan system of Catholic education in the United States, and introduced the Forty Hours' Devotion in America. He began building the Cathedral of Saints Peter and Paul and worked tirelessly for the faith formation of children and adults.",
      "He wrote two catechisms and a Bible history, visited parishes regularly despite the vast size of his diocese, and learned Italian and Spanish to minister to new immigrant communities. He maintained the simple lifestyle of a Redemptorist, living frugally and giving generously to the poor.",
      "On January 5, 1860, Bishop Neumann collapsed on a street in Philadelphia and died at age 48. Thousands attended his funeral, with many reporting favors received through his intercession. He was beatified by Pope Paul VI in 1963 and canonized on June 19, 1977, by Pope Paul VI, becoming the first American bishop and the first American male saint to be canonized.",

    short_bio: "Holy Cross Brother, devoted to St. Joseph, doorkeeper who built the great Oratory in Montreal",
    biography: [
      "St. André Bessette was born Alfred Bessette on August 9, 1845, in Mont-Saint-Grégoire, Quebec, Canada, the eighth of twelve children in a poor French-Canadian family. His father, a carpenter, died in a logging accident when Alfred was nine, and his mother died when he was twelve, leaving him an orphan.",
      "Alfred suffered from poor health throughout his life, including chronic stomach problems that left him weak and unable to do heavy physical labor. He had little formal education and struggled to find steady work. Various family members took him in, but he moved frequently, working odd jobs as a farmhand, shoemaker, baker, and blacksmith's apprentice.",
      "At age 25, Alfred felt called to religious life and sought admission to the Congregation of Holy Cross. The pastor who recommended him wrote: 'I am sending you a saint.' Due to his poor health and lack of education, the community hesitated, but Father André Provençal accepted him, saying, 'If this young man becomes unable to work, he will at least know how to pray.'",
      "In 1870, Alfred received the religious habit and the name Brother André. For the next 40 years, from 1870 to 1909, he served as doorkeeper (porter) at Notre Dame College in Montreal. His duties included answering the door, welcoming visitors, delivering mail, and tending to minor tasks. Many thought this simple assignment suited his limitations, but God had other plans.",
      "Brother André developed an extraordinary devotion to St. Joseph and believed strongly in his intercessory power. He began praying with sick people who came to the door, often rubbing them with oil from a lamp that burned before a statue of St. Joseph. Remarkable healings were reported, and his reputation for holiness and miraculous cures spread rapidly.",
      "As more people sought his prayers, Brother André began receiving visitors in a small streetcar shelter near the college. In 1904, he was given permission to build a small chapel dedicated to St. Joseph on Mount Royal, across from the college. He personally went door to door collecting funds, and pilgrims began arriving in greater numbers.",
      "The small chapel grew over the years, and Brother André envisioned a grand basilica to honor St. Joseph. In 1917, construction began on what would become Saint Joseph's Oratory, one of the world's largest churches. Brother André lived to see the crypt church completed but died before the great dome was finished.",
      "Brother André died on January 6, 1937, at age 91. Over one million people filed past his casket during the six-day viewing period. He was beatified by Pope John Paul II in 1982 and canonized by Pope Benedict XVI on October 17, 2010. Saint Joseph's Oratory receives millions of visitors annually and remains a major pilgrimage site.",

    name: "St. Anthony",
    feast_day: "01-17",
    short_bio: "Abbot and father of monasticism, desert hermit who battled demons",
    biography: [
      "St. Anthony the Great (also known as St. Anthony of Egypt, St. Anthony the Abbot, or St. Anthony of the Desert) was born around 251 AD in Herakleopolis, Egypt, to wealthy Christian parents. After their death when he was about 18 or 20 years old, he inherited a considerable estate and was responsible for the care of his younger sister.",
      "One day while attending church, Anthony heard the Gospel reading: 'If you wish to be perfect, go, sell what you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me' (Matthew 19:21). Taking this as a personal call from God, Anthony sold his possessions, placed his sister with a community of virgins, and began living an ascetic life near his village.",
      "Around 285, Anthony withdrew into the desert, seeking deeper solitude. He spent about 20 years living in complete isolation in an abandoned Roman fort at Pispir (now Der el Memun). During this period, he engaged in intense spiritual combat with demons, who attacked him physically and mentally, appearing as wild beasts and tempting him with various visions. Anthony countered these assaults through prayer, fasting, and manual labor.",
      "Despite his desire for solitude, Anthony's reputation for holiness attracted others seeking spiritual guidance. Around 305, disciples gathered outside his hermitage, asking to learn from him. Anthony emerged from his seclusion and organized them into a loose community of hermits—individual monks living in separate cells but gathering for communal worship and instruction. This marked the beginning of Christian monasticism.",
      "Anthony's teaching emphasized constant prayer, contemplation of Scripture, manual work, and the importance of spiritual warfare against demonic forces. He stressed the virtues of poverty, humility, and charity. Though he lived simply and without formal education, his wisdom was so profound that even philosophers sought his counsel.",
      "Around 311, during the persecution under Emperor Maximinus, Anthony went to Alexandria hoping for martyrdom while ministering to imprisoned Christians. Though he was not arrested, he courageously visited and encouraged the martyrs. After the persecution ended, he returned to the desert.",
      "In his later years, Anthony lived on Mount Kolzim near the Red Sea, where his final hermitage became the site of the Monastery of Saint Anthony, one of the oldest Christian monasteries still in existence. He made two more trips to Alexandria: once to refute Arian heresy and once to support St. Athanasius, who later wrote Anthony's biography.",
      "Anthony died on January 17, 356, at about 105 years of age. According to his wishes, his burial place was kept secret to prevent his relics from being venerated. His influence on monasticism was immense, inspiring countless men and women to embrace the solitary life. St. Athanasius's 'Life of Anthony' became one of the most widely read books in the ancient Christian world.",

      "Priest, educator, and founder of the Salesian Society dedicated to the education of poor and disadvantaged youth",
    biography: [
      "St. John Bosco was born on August 16, 1815, in Becchi, a small hamlet in Piedmont, Italy. He was the youngest son of Francesco Bosco and Margherita Occhiena. His father died when he was only two years old, leaving his mother to raise him and his two older brothers in poverty but with strong faith.",
      "From an early age, John showed a deep spiritual sensitivity. At the age of nine, he had a prophetic dream that would shape his future vocation. In this dream, he saw himself transforming wild animals into gentle lambs, and a majestic figure (later understood to be Jesus) and a lady (later understood to be Mary) told him: 'Not with blows, but with charity and gentleness must you draw these friends to the path of virtue.'",
      "Despite financial hardships, John was determined to pursue education. He worked as a shepherd, tailor, carpenter, and baker to support himself while studying. A kind priest, Fr. Joseph Cafasso, recognized his potential and helped him enter the seminary. John was ordained a priest on June 5, 1841, in Turin.",
      "As a young priest in industrializing Turin, Don Bosco (as he came to be called) was deeply affected by the plight of poor boys who flocked to the city looking for work. Many ended up homeless, exploited, or imprisoned. He began gathering these boys on Sundays for recreation, catechism, and Mass, establishing what he called an 'oratory' – a combination of playground, school, church, and home.",
      "Don Bosco developed a unique educational approach called the 'Preventive System,' based on reason, religion, and loving-kindness rather than punishment. He believed in creating a family atmosphere where young people could grow in faith, honesty, and skills for life and work. His method emphasized presence among the young, looking for the good in each person, and creating an environment that encouraged growth.",
      "In 1859, Don Bosco founded the Society of St. Francis de Sales (Salesians), a religious congregation dedicated to the education and care of poor and disadvantaged youth. With St. Mary Domenica Mazzarello, he later co-founded the Daughters of Mary Help of Christians (Salesian Sisters) in 1872 to extend similar work among girls. He also established the Salesian Cooperators, lay people who shared in the Salesian mission.",
      "Despite facing opposition and numerous challenges, Don Bosco's work expanded rapidly. He was a prolific writer, publishing numerous books and pamphlets on education and spirituality. He was also known for his prophetic dreams, practical wisdom, and tireless work for the salvation of souls, particularly the young.",
      "Don Bosco was also a skilled negotiator who helped ease tensions between the Vatican and the newly formed Italian state. He supervised the building of the Basilica of Mary Help of Christians in Turin and sent the first Salesian missionaries to Argentina in 1875, beginning the international expansion of his work.",
      "Worn out by his tireless efforts, Don Bosco died on January 31, 1888, in Turin. His last words to his Salesians were: 'Love each other as brothers. Do good to all and evil to none.' At the time of his death, there were 250 Salesian houses in 10 different countries serving over 130,000 children.",
      "Don Bosco was canonized by Pope Pius XI on Easter Sunday, April 1, 1934. He is known as the 'Father and Teacher of Youth' and his educational method continues to influence modern pedagogy. Today, the Salesian Family serves young people in more than 130 countries worldwide.",

    short_bio: "Pope and martyr who organized the Roman Church and died during Decian persecution",
    biography: [
      "St. Fabian was a layman and Roman citizen who became pope in an extraordinary way. In January 236, he came to Rome when the clergy and people were meeting to elect a new pope. According to the historian Eusebius, while the assembly was considering various candidates, a dove suddenly descended and settled on Fabian's head. Taking this as a sign of divine selection reminiscent of the Holy Spirit's descent at Christ's baptism, the people unanimously acclaimed Fabian as pope.",
      "Pope Fabian proved to be an excellent and energetic administrator. He organized the Roman Church into seven deaconries, each supervised by a deacon responsible for the temporal and spiritual care of the poor in that district. He also appointed seven subdeacons to collect the acts of the martyrs, establishing an early system of record-keeping that would become invaluable for Church history.",
      "During Fabian's pontificate, which lasted 14 years, the Church enjoyed a period of relative peace. He used this time to strengthen Church structures and promote missions beyond Rome. He reportedly sent seven missionary bishops to evangelize Gaul (France), helping to establish Christianity in that region. He also brought the body of Pope St. Pontian back to Rome from Sardinia, where Pontian had died in exile.",
      "In 250, Emperor Decius began a systematic and violent persecution of Christians, demanding that all citizens perform public sacrifices to the Roman gods and obtain certificates proving their compliance. Pope Fabian was one of the first and most prominent victims of this persecution. He was arrested and martyred on January 20, 250.",
      "St. Cyprian, Bishop of Carthage and contemporary of Fabian, wrote of his death: 'The deposing of Fabian's body took place in a spirit of great glory.' Fabian was buried in the catacombs of St. Callixtus, and his original epitaph, one of the few papal epitaphs to survive from this early period, can still be seen: 'Fabian, bishop, martyr.'",
      "Archaeological discoveries in 1915 confirmed the location of Fabian's tomb in the papal crypt of the catacomb of Callixtus, with fragments of a Greek inscription with his name and the title of 'bishop' (episkopos) and 'martyr' (martyr). His pontificate is remembered as a time of prudent governance and his martyrdom as a testament to his courage in faith.",

    biography: [
      "St. Sebastian is believed to have been born around 256 AD in Narbonne, Gaul (modern-day France), or possibly in Milan, Italy. He was raised as a Christian and became a soldier in the Roman army around 283 AD, eventually attaining the rank of captain in the Praetorian Guard under Emperor Diocletian.",
      "Despite the danger, Sebastian used his position of influence to help persecuted Christians. He visited Christians condemned to death, bringing them comfort and encouragement. He also preached the Gospel and converted many to Christianity, including the prefect Chromatius and his son Tiburtius, whom Sebastian miraculously cured of a serious illness.",
      "Sebastian's Christian activities remained hidden for some time because of his excellent reputation as a soldier and his favor with the emperors Diocletian and Maximian. However, his faith was eventually discovered. The emperors, feeling betrayed by one they had trusted, condemned him to death.",
      "According to tradition, Sebastian was tied to a stake and shot with arrows by fellow soldiers. Left for dead, he was found barely alive by St. Irene of Rome, a widow who brought him to her home and nursed him back to health. His recovery was considered miraculous.",
      "Rather than going into hiding, Sebastian boldly confronted Diocletian on a stairway, denouncing him for his cruelty to Christians. Diocletian, astonished to see Sebastian alive, ordered him to be beaten to death with clubs. Sebastian's body was then thrown into the Cloaca Maxima, the main sewer of Rome. A Christian woman named Lucina, directed by a vision, recovered his body and buried it in the catacombs beneath the Basilica of San Sebastiano on the Appian Way.",
      "St. Sebastian's martyrdom occurred around 288 AD. His tomb became a popular pilgrimage site, and his intercession was credited with ending a plague in Rome in 680 AD. He is often depicted in art as a young man tied to a tree or post and pierced with arrows, though this represents only his first martyrdom. He became one of the most popular saints of the medieval period.",

      "St. Agnes was born in Rome around 291 AD to a noble Christian family. Her name derives from the Greek word 'hagnē' meaning 'pure' or 'chaste,' though it was later associated with the Latin word 'agnus' meaning 'lamb,' making her a symbol of purity and innocence.",
      "According to tradition, Agnes was extraordinarily beautiful and from an early age had consecrated her virginity to God. By the age of 12 or 13, her beauty and noble status attracted many suitors from wealthy Roman families, including the son of the prefect of Rome. Agnes refused all proposals, declaring that she was betrothed to Christ alone.",
      "When the prefect's son persisted and was rejected, he fell desperately ill from grief. His father, learning that Agnes was a Christian, attempted to force her to renounce her faith and either marry his son or serve as a priestess in the temple of Vesta, the Roman goddess. Agnes steadfastly refused both options, maintaining her vow of virginity and her faith in Christ.",
      "As punishment for her refusal and her Christian faith, during the persecution under Emperor Diocletian, Agnes was subjected to various torments. One account states that she was dragged through the streets naked to a house of prostitution, but her hair miraculously grew to cover her body. When a young man looked at her with lustful intent, he was struck blind (and later healed through her prayers).",
      "Finally, Agnes was condemned to death. According to tradition, she was either beheaded or stabbed in the throat with a sword around 304 AD, at approximately 12 or 13 years of age. Her courage in the face of martyrdom, despite her youth, made a profound impression on early Christians.",
      "Agnes was buried on the Via Nomentana in Rome, and a church was built over her tomb around 350 AD by Constantine's daughter, Constantina. This became the Basilica of Sant'Agnese fuori le mura (St. Agnes Outside the Walls). A second church, Sant'Agnese in Agone, was built in the 17th century on the site in Piazza Navona where tradition says she was exposed.",
      "St. Ambrose, St. Augustine, and Pope Damasus I wrote about St. Agnes, testifying to the widespread veneration of this young martyr in the early Church. She is mentioned in the Roman Canon (Eucharistic Prayer I) and has been venerated continuously since the early centuries of Christianity.

      "St. Vincent of Saragossa was born in the late 3rd century in Huesca, Spain. He came from a noble family and received his education under Bishop Valerius of Saragossa, who ordained him as a deacon. Vincent's eloquence and learning led Valerius, who apparently had a speech impediment, to entrust him with preaching and teaching responsibilities.",
      "In 303 AD, during the persecution under Emperor Diocletian and his co-emperor Maximian, the elderly Bishop Valerius and his deacon Vincent were arrested for their Christian faith. They were brought before Dacian, the Roman governor of Spain, in Valencia.",
      "When questioned, Bishop Valerius allowed Vincent to speak for both of them. Vincent boldly confessed their faith in Christ and eloquently defended Christianity, refusing to surrender the sacred books or to offer sacrifice to the Roman gods. Impressed by Vincent's courage and learning but enraged by his defiance, Dacian sent Valerius into exile but decided to make an example of Vincent.",
      "Vincent was subjected to some of the most brutal tortures recorded in early Christian martyrology. He was stretched on the rack, his flesh was torn with iron hooks, and he was roasted on a gridiron heated over burning coals. Throughout these torments, Vincent remained steadfast, praying and singing hymns. His courage and joy in suffering allegedly so unnerved his tormentors that some converted to Christianity.",
      "According to tradition, the frustrated governor then ordered Vincent thrown into a dungeon with the floor covered in broken pottery shards. Yet even there, angels appeared to comfort him, and a divine light filled the dark cell. When the guards saw this miraculous sight, they too converted to Christianity.",
      "Vincent died from his wounds in 304 AD, around January 22 or 23. His body was cast into a field to be devoured by wild beasts, but it was miraculously protected by ravens. Christians eventually recovered his body and gave it an honorable burial. His relics were later translated to several locations, with major shrines in Lisbon and Paris.",
      "St. Vincent became one of the most celebrated martyrs of the early Church in Spain and France.

His feast day was widely celebrated throughout medieval Europe, and many churches and towns are dedicated to him.",

    biography: [
      "St. Marianne Cope was born Barbara Koob on January 23, 1838, in Heppenheim, Germany. In 1839, her family emigrated to the United States, settling in Utica, New York. Barbara was the eldest of ten children, and when her father became disabled, she left school at age 13 to work in a factory to help support her family.",
      "After her father's death, when her siblings were old enough to support themselves, Barbara entered the Sisters of St. Francis of Syracuse, New York, in 1862, taking the religious name Marianne. She professed her vows in 1863 and dedicated herself to works of charity, particularly in healthcare and education.",
      "Sister Marianne worked in several Catholic hospitals in central New York, eventually becoming administrator of St. Joseph's Hospital in Syracuse. She was a pioneering hospital administrator who embraced antiseptic practices and accepted patients of all backgrounds, including those whom other hospitals refused—alcoholics, immigrants, and the poor.",
      "In 1883, Sister Marianne received a letter from Father Damien de Veuster in Hawaii, pleading for sisters to help care for patients with Hansen's disease (leprosy) who were forcibly isolated on the island of Molokai. After more than 50 religious congregations had refused, Mother Marianne and six companions volunteered, arriving in Honolulu in November 1883.",
      "Mother Marianne first established and supervised a hospital for leprosy patients in Honolulu. In 1888, after Father Damien contracted leprosy and needed assistance, she agreed to move permanently to the remote Kalaupapa peninsula on Molokai to continue his work. She arrived shortly before his death in 1889 and took over the care of the settlement.",
      "For the next 30 years, Mother Marianne served the exiled leprosy patients with extraordinary compassion and dignity. She never contracted the disease herself, despite having no protection and performing tasks like cleaning patients' infected wounds. She created a homelike atmosphere, establishing schools, organizing choirs, and beautifying the grounds with flowers. She insisted that patients be treated with respect and dignity, not as outcasts.",
      "Mother Marianne died on August 9, 1918, at age 80, in Kalaupapa, having never left the island after her arrival in 1888. She was buried there in the cemetery she had helped establish. She was beatified by Pope Benedict XVI on May 14, 2005, and canonized by the same pope on October 21, 2012. Her feast day is celebrated on January 23, the anniversary of her birth.",

    biography: [
      "St. Timothy was born in Lystra (in modern-day Turkey) to a Greek father and a Jewish-Christian mother named Eunice. His grandmother Lois was also a believer. Timothy was instructed in the Scriptures from childhood and converted to Christianity through St. Paul's preaching during Paul's first missionary journey around 47-48 AD.",
      "When Paul returned to Lystra on his second missionary journey around 50 AD, he chose Timothy to accompany him, having heard excellent reports about the young man from the believers in Lystra and Iconium. Paul had Timothy circumcised so he could minister effectively to Jewish communities. Timothy became Paul's most trusted companion and co-worker.",
      "Timothy accompanied Paul on much of his second and third missionary journeys, traveling through Asia Minor and Greece. Paul sent him on important missions to Thessalonica, Corinth, and Philippi. Timothy is mentioned as co-sender in six of Paul's letters (2 Corinthians, Philippians, Colossians, 1 & 2 Thessalonians, and Philemon).",
      "Paul later appointed Timothy as leader of the church in Ephesus, one of the most important cities in the early Christian world. Paul wrote two letters to Timothy (1 and 2 Timothy) providing pastoral guidance for leading the community, organizing ministry, dealing with false teachers, and maintaining sound doctrine. These letters reveal Paul's deep affection for Timothy, whom he calls 'my true child in faith' and 'my beloved son.'",
      "According to tradition, Timothy served as bishop of Ephesus for many years. He is said to have been martyred around 97 AD during the reign of Emperor Nerva or Trajan, killed by an angry mob while trying to stop a pagan festival procession honoring the goddess Diana. His relics were later translated to Constantinople.",
      "St. Titus was a Greek convert to Christianity who also became a trusted companion and co-worker of St. Paul. Unlike Timothy, Titus was not circumcised, and Paul used his case to argue that Gentile converts did not need to follow Jewish ceremonial law. Titus is mentioned in Paul's letters to the Galatians and 2 Corinthians.",
      "Titus accompanied Paul on various missionary journeys and was sent on difficult assignments, including mediating disputes in the troubled Corinthian community. Paul praises Titus's dedication, tact, and effectiveness in 2 Corinthians. Paul later appointed Titus as leader of the church on the island of Crete, writing him a pastoral letter (the Epistle to Titus) with instructions for organizing the church and maintaining proper doctrine and conduct.",
      "According to tradition, Titus remained in Crete as its first bishop and died there peacefully at an advanced age around 96-107 AD. His feast is celebrated together with Timothy on January 26, honoring these two faithful disciples who helped establish and guide the early Church under Paul's mentorship.",

    biography: [
      "St. Angela Merici was born on March 21, 1474, in Desenzano del Garda, a small town on the southern shore of Lake Garda in northern Italy. She was orphaned at age 10 and raised by a wealthy uncle. After her sister's sudden death, Angela became a Franciscan tertiary and dedicated herself to a life of prayer and service.",
      "Angela felt called to address the religious ignorance she witnessed, especially among young girls. She began teaching catechism to poor children in her neighborhood, gathering them in her home for instruction. Her method emphasized love, patience, and respect for the dignity of each child. Her work gained attention, and other women joined her in this apostolate.",
      "In 1516, Angela experienced a mystical vision while climbing the hill to the church at Brudazzo. She saw a company of maidens descending on rays of light, accompanied by angels. A voice told her that before her death, she would found a company of virgins dedicated to God's service. This vision guided her future work.",
      "In 1524, Angela made a pilgrimage to the Holy Land. According to tradition, she went blind during the journey, though this did not stop her from completing the pilgrimage. Her sight was miraculously restored on her return journey at the same place where she had lost it. She also made pilgrimages to Rome, where she was granted an audience with Pope Clement VII, who urged her to remain in Rome. Angela declined, feeling her work was in Brescia.",
      "On November 25, 1535, in Brescia, Angela formally founded the Company of St. Ursula (Ursulines), gathering 28 young women who dedicated themselves to God while continuing to live in their own homes and families. This was revolutionary for the time—a women's religious community without cloister, religious habit, or solemn vows. They committed themselves to Christian education, especially of girls.",
      "Angela's original vision was of a flexible form of religious life adapted to the needs of the time. Her Rule, written down before her death, emphasized personal freedom, trust, and adaptability. She told her followers: 'Disorder in society is the result of disorder in the family. Since men will not go to church, women must go to their homes. If people will not go to God, women must go to them.'",
      "Angela died on January 27, 1540, in Brescia. After her death, the Ursulines grew rapidly and eventually adopted monastic practices to comply with Church requirements of the Counter-Reformation. They became one of the largest teaching orders for women in the Catholic Church, pioneering girls' education worldwide. Angela was canonized by Pope Pius VII in 1807.",
