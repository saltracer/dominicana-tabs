    feast_day: "03-04",
    short_bio: "Prince of Poland and Lithuania, patron of youth and purity",
    biography: [
      "St. Casimir was born on October 3, 1458, in Kraków, Poland, the third of thirteen children of King Casimir IV of Poland and Queen Elizabeth of Austria. As a prince, he received an excellent education and was trained in the arts of warfare, diplomacy, and statecraft.",
      "From an early age, Casimir showed exceptional piety and devotion. He spent long hours in prayer, often rising at night to pray before the Blessed Sacrament. He had a special devotion to the Eucharist and the Blessed Virgin Mary, and reportedly composed a hymn in her honor, 'Omni die dic Mariae' (Daily, daily sing to Mary).",
      "Despite his royal status and wealth, Casimir lived simply. He practiced severe self-discipline, wore a hair shirt, slept on the floor, and fasted frequently. He was known for his chastity and his concern for the poor, often giving away his possessions to those in need.",
      "At age 13, Casimir was named by the Hungarian nobles to be their king, and his father sent him with an army to claim the throne. However, Casimir learned that the rightful king, Matthias Corvinus, had returned, and rather than fight an unjust war, he disbanded his army and returned home. His father was initially angry and banished him, but later recognized his son's wisdom and moral courage.",
      "Casimir refused several offers of marriage to princesses, stating that he had consecrated his virginity to God. When his father and brothers were away, Casimir served as viceroy, ruling with justice and compassion. He defended the rights of the poor and worked to maintain peace.",
      "Casimir contracted tuberculosis and died on March 4, 1484, at Grodno, Lithuania, at the age of 25. According to tradition, he was buried with a copy of his Marian hymn, which was found incorrupt when his tomb was opened 120 years later. He was canonized in 1522 by Pope Leo X.",

    feast_day: "03-07",
    short_bio: "Martyrs of Carthage whose diary provides one of the earliest Christian accounts of martyrdom",
    biography: [
      "St. Perpetua was a 22-year-old married noblewoman and young mother living in Carthage, North Africa (modern-day Tunisia). In 203 AD, during the persecution under Emperor Septimius Severus, she was arrested along with four other catechumens, including a pregnant slave woman named Felicity.",
      "While imprisoned, Perpetua kept a diary that provides one of the most remarkable firsthand accounts of early Christian martyrdom. She describes her father's repeated attempts to persuade her to renounce her faith to save herself. Despite her love for her family and her nursing infant, Perpetua remained steadfast, saying, 'I am a Christian.'",
      "The group was baptized while in prison. Perpetua's father brought her baby to her in prison, pleading with her to consider her child and parents. She wrote: 'My father... kept urging me, Father, said I, do you see this vase here? Could it be called by any other name than what it is? And I cannot be called anything other than what I am, a Christian.'",
      "Felicity was eight months pregnant when arrested. Under Roman law, pregnant women could not be executed, so she feared being separated from her companions. She and the group prayed, and she gave birth prematurely to a daughter three days before their execution. The baby was adopted by a Christian woman. When Felicity cried out in labor, a guard mocked her, asking how she would face the beasts. She replied, 'What I suffer now, I suffer by myself. But then another will be inside me who will suffer for me, just as I shall be suffering for Him.'",
      "Perpetua recorded several prophetic visions in her diary, including seeing her deceased brother in purgatory and praying for his relief, and seeing a golden ladder to heaven guarded by a dragon, which she trampled while climbing to meet the Good Shepherd.",
      "On March 7, 203, the prisoners were led into the amphitheater for the games. They faced wild beasts with remarkable courage. Perpetua and Felicity were tossed by a mad cow but survived the initial attack. Finally, they were killed by the sword. Perpetua reportedly guided the hesitant gladiator's sword to her throat.",
      "The Passion of Saints Perpetua and Felicity, based largely on Perpetua's own diary, became one of the most widely read texts in the early Church. St. Augustine preached sermons about them. They are mentioned in Eucharistic Prayer I and have been venerated continuously since their martyrdom. Their witness shows the strength of faith that transcends gender, social class, and even the natural bonds of motherhood.",

    biography: [
      "St. Frances of Rome was born Francesca Bussa de' Leoni in 1384 in Rome to a wealthy and noble family. At age eleven, she wanted to become a nun, but in obedience to her parents, she married Lorenzo de' Ponziani, a wealthy nobleman, at age thirteen.",
      "Frances proved to be a devoted wife and mother, bearing three children. She and her sister-in-law Vannozza began visiting the sick and poor in Rome's hospitals and homes, bringing them food, medicine, and comfort. During a plague and famine in Rome, Frances sold her jewels and fine clothing to help the needy.",
      "Frances experienced numerous mystical visions throughout her life. She saw her guardian angel, who reportedly guided her and protected her from danger. She also had visions of hell, purgatory, and heaven, which deepened her devotion and inspired her charitable works.",
      "The family suffered greatly during the papal schism and political turmoil in Rome. Their properties were confiscated, their home was destroyed, and Frances's husband was wounded and imprisoned. Her sons were taken as hostages. Through all these trials, Frances remained patient and trusting in God, continuing her works of charity.",
      "In 1425, with ecclesiastical approval, Frances founded a society of women called the Oblates of Mary, who lived in the world but were dedicated to prayer and service to the poor. They later became the Oblates of Tor de' Specchi, establishing their community in Rome.",
      "After her husband's death in 1436, Frances joined the community she had founded, living there for the last four years of her life. She continued her charitable works and spiritual guidance until her death on March 9, 1440.",
      "Frances was canonized in 1608 by Pope Paul V. She is particularly remembered for showing how holiness can be achieved in the married state and amidst domestic responsibilities. She is the patron saint of motorists (because of her guardian angel who lit her way) and of Roman housewives.",

    biography: [
      "St. Katherine Drexel was born in Philadelphia on November 26, 1858, to a wealthy and prominent banking family. Her father, Francis Anthony Drexel, was a business partner of J.P. Morgan, and her mother, Hannah Langstroth, died shortly after Katherine's birth. Her father remarried Emma Bouvier, who was devoted to her stepdaughters and taught them that their wealth was meant to be shared with others.",
      "From an early age, Katherine witnessed her family's generosity to the poor. Every week, her parents opened their home to distribute food, clothing, and rent money to those in need. The family traveled extensively, and during these trips, Katherine became aware of the plight of Native Americans on reservations and the oppression faced by African Americans.",
      "After her father's death in 1885, Katherine and her sisters inherited a vast fortune. Already inclined toward religious life, Katherine was deeply moved by the needs of Native Americans and African Americans. During a private audience with Pope Leo XIII in 1887, she asked him to send missionaries to help with the Native American missions she was funding. The Pope suggested that she become a missionary herself.",
      "After a period of discernment, Katherine entered the Sisters of Mercy novitiate in Pittsburgh in 1889. Two years later, she founded her own religious congregation, the Sisters of the Blessed Sacrament for Indians and Colored People (now known as the Sisters of the Blessed Sacrament). She took her final vows in 1891, dedicating herself and her inheritance to the service of Native Americans and African Americans.",
      "Over the next 40 years, Mother Drexel used her personal fortune of about $20 million to fund schools for Native Americans and African Americans across the United States. She established Xavier University in New Orleans, the first Catholic university in the United States for African Americans. By the time of her death, she had established 145 missions, 50 schools for African Americans, and 12 schools for Native Americans.",
      "In 1935, Katherine suffered a heart attack, after which she retired to a life of prayer and contemplation. She spent the final 20 years of her life in prayerful retirement at the motherhouse of her order in Cornwells Heights, Pennsylvania. She died on March 3, 1955, at the age of 96.",
      "Katherine Drexel was beatified by Pope John Paul II on November 20, 1988, and canonized on October 1, 2000, becoming only the second American-born saint. Her feast day is celebrated on March 3. She is remembered for her dedication to racial justice and her commitment to providing quality education to those who were marginalized in American society.",

      "St. Euphrasia (also known as Eupraxia) was born in Constantinople around 380 AD to noble parents who were related to Emperor Theodosius I. Her father died when she was only five years old, and her mother, also named Euphrasia, decided to leave the imperial court and move to Egypt.",
      "In Egypt, mother and daughter settled near a monastery of 130 nuns in the Thebaid desert. Young Euphrasia was fascinated by the nuns' way of life and, at the age of seven, begged to join the community. With her mother's consent, she was accepted as a novice.",
      "When Euphrasia was twelve, her mother died, leaving her a substantial inheritance and estates. Emperor Theodosius, as her guardian, arranged a marriage for her to a wealthy senator. However, Euphrasia wrote to the emperor, asking to be released from this engagement so she could dedicate her life entirely to God.",
      "Impressed by her devotion, Theodosius granted her request and, following her wishes, distributed her inheritance to the poor and freed her slaves. Euphrasia then took formal vows and became known for her extraordinary humility, obedience, and asceticism.",
      "One of the most famous stories about Euphrasia involves an act of obedience. The abbess, testing her, ordered her to move a pile of large stones from one place to another, then back again, repeatedly for many days. Euphrasia obeyed without question, seeing in this seemingly pointless task an opportunity to grow in virtue.",
      "She died around 410 AD at the young age of 30. Her life was recorded in a Greek biography that became popular in the medieval period, spreading her veneration throughout both Eastern and Western Churches.",

      "St. Patrick was born in Roman Britain in the late 4th century, around 385 AD. At the age of 16, he was captured by Irish raiders and taken to Ireland as a slave, where he worked as a shepherd for six years.",
      "During his captivity, Patrick turned to God in prayer. He later wrote that he prayed many times a day, and his faith grew stronger. After six years, he heard a voice telling him that he would soon go home and that a ship was ready for him. He escaped, traveled about 200 miles to a port, and found a ship that took him back to Britain.",
      "After returning home, Patrick had a vision in which he received a letter titled 'The Voice of the Irish.' In the vision, he heard the Irish people calling him to come back and walk among them. This inspired him to study for the priesthood, and he was eventually ordained a bishop.",
      "Around 432 AD, Patrick returned to Ireland as a missionary. Despite facing opposition from local druids and pagan leaders, he successfully converted thousands to Christianity. He used the shamrock, a three-leaved plant, to explain the concept of the Holy Trinity.",
      "Patrick established churches, monasteries, and schools throughout Ireland, laying the foundation for the strong Christian tradition that would later earn Ireland the title 'Island of Saints and Scholars.' His missionary work continued for nearly 30 years.",
      "He died on March 17, 461 AD, which is now celebrated as St. Patrick's Day. His spiritual autobiography, the 'Confession,' provides much of what we know about his life and mission. He is venerated as the primary patron saint of Ireland.",

      "St. Turibius Alfonso de Mogrovejo was born on November 16, 1538, in Mayorga, León, Spain, to a noble family. He studied at the University of Salamanca, where he earned a doctorate in law and became a professor of law at the age of 27.",
      "King Philip II of Spain appointed Turibius as chief judge of the Inquisition at Granada in 1574. Though he was a layman and had never studied theology formally, Pope Gregory XIII appointed him Archbishop of Lima, Peru, in 1579. Turibius initially resisted, feeling unworthy, but eventually accepted in obedience. He was ordained a priest and then consecrated as bishop in 1580.",
      "When Turibius arrived in Peru in 1581, he found a vast archdiocese in need of reform. Spanish colonizers were exploiting the indigenous peoples, and many clergy lived worldly lifestyles. Turibius immediately began reforming the Church and defending the rights of the native populations.",
      "Over the next 25 years, Turibius made three extensive pastoral visitations of his enormous archdiocese, which covered thousands of miles from Panama to Chile. He traveled on foot or by mule through jungles, deserts, and mountains, reaching remote villages where no bishop had ever been. He confirmed approximately half a million people during these journeys.",
      "Turibius established the first seminary in the Americas in Lima and built churches, schools, convents, and hospitals throughout his archdiocese. He learned native languages to better minister to indigenous peoples and insisted that clergy do the same. He fought against the exploitation and abuse of native peoples by Spanish colonizers, often confronting powerful interests.",
      "He convened three provincial councils and thirteen diocesan synods to implement the reforms of the Council of Trent and to address local pastoral needs. His efforts helped establish a well-organized Church structure in South America. He also promoted devotion to the Eucharist and worked to eliminate superstitious practices.",
      "Among those Turibius confirmed were St. Rose of Lima (the first saint of the Americas) and St. Martin de Porres. He recognized the holiness in these two future saints and encouraged their vocations. His own life of prayer, penance, and pastoral dedication set an example for the entire archdiocese.",
      "St. Turibius died on March 23, 1606, at Saña, Peru, while on a pastoral visit. His last words were from Psalm 122: 'I rejoiced when they said to me, Let us go to the house of the Lord.' He was beatified in 1679 and canonized by Pope Benedict XIII in 1726. He is the patron saint of Latin American bishops and of native rights.",
