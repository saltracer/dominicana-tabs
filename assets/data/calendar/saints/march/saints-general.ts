    name: "St. Katherine Drexel",
    feast_day: "03-03",
    short_bio: "American heiress who became a religious sister and founded the Sisters of the Blessed Sacrament",
    biography: [
      "St. Katherine Drexel was born in Philadelphia on November 26, 1858, to a wealthy and prominent banking family. Her father, Francis Anthony Drexel, was a business partner of J.P. Morgan, and her mother, Hannah Langstroth, died shortly after Katherine's birth. Her father remarried Emma Bouvier, who was devoted to her stepdaughters and taught them that their wealth was meant to be shared with others.",
      "From an early age, Katherine witnessed her family's generosity to the poor. Every week, her parents opened their home to distribute food, clothing, and rent money to those in need. The family traveled extensively, and during these trips, Katherine became aware of the plight of Native Americans on reservations and the oppression faced by African Americans.",
      "After her father's death in 1885, Katherine and her sisters inherited a vast fortune. Already inclined toward religious life, Katherine was deeply moved by the needs of Native Americans and African Americans. During a private audience with Pope Leo XIII in 1887, she asked him to send missionaries to help with the Native American missions she was funding. The Pope suggested that she become a missionary herself.",
      "After a period of discernment, Katherine entered the Sisters of Mercy novitiate in Pittsburgh in 1889. Two years later, she founded her own religious congregation, the Sisters of the Blessed Sacrament for Indians and Colored People (now known as the Sisters of the Blessed Sacrament). She took her final vows in 1891, dedicating herself and her inheritance to the service of Native Americans and African Americans.",
      "Over the next 40 years, Mother Drexel used her personal fortune of about $20 million to fund schools for Native Americans and African Americans across the United States. She established Xavier University in New Orleans, the first Catholic university in the United States for African Americans. By the time of her death, she had established 145 missions, 50 schools for African Americans, and 12 schools for Native Americans.",
      "In 1935, Katherine suffered a heart attack, after which she retired to a life of prayer and contemplation. She spent the final 20 years of her life in prayerful retirement at the motherhouse of her order in Cornwells Heights, Pennsylvania. She died on March 3, 1955, at the age of 96.",
      "Katherine Drexel was beatified by Pope John Paul II on November 20, 1988, and canonized on October 1, 2000, becoming only the second American-born saint. Her feast day is celebrated on March 3. She is remembered for her dedication to racial justice and her commitment to providing quality education to those who were marginalized in American society.",

    name: "St. Euphrasia",
    feast_day: "03-13",
    short_bio: "Byzantine nun known for her extraordinary humility and obedience",
    biography: [
      "St. Euphrasia (also known as Eupraxia) was born in Constantinople around 380 AD to noble parents who were related to Emperor Theodosius I. Her father died when she was only five years old, and her mother, also named Euphrasia, decided to leave the imperial court and move to Egypt.",
      "In Egypt, mother and daughter settled near a monastery of 130 nuns in the Thebaid desert. Young Euphrasia was fascinated by the nuns' way of life and, at the age of seven, begged to join the community. With her mother's consent, she was accepted as a novice.",
      "When Euphrasia was twelve, her mother died, leaving her a substantial inheritance and estates. Emperor Theodosius, as her guardian, arranged a marriage for her to a wealthy senator. However, Euphrasia wrote to the emperor, asking to be released from this engagement so she could dedicate her life entirely to God.",
      "Impressed by her devotion, Theodosius granted her request and, following her wishes, distributed her inheritance to the poor and freed her slaves. Euphrasia then took formal vows and became known for her extraordinary humility, obedience, and asceticism.",
      "One of the most famous stories about Euphrasia involves an act of obedience. The abbess, testing her, ordered her to move a pile of large stones from one place to another, then back again, repeatedly for many days. Euphrasia obeyed without question, seeing in this seemingly pointless task an opportunity to grow in virtue.",
      "She died around 410 AD at the young age of 30. Her life was recorded in a Greek biography that became popular in the medieval period, spreading her veneration throughout both Eastern and Western Churches.",

    name: "St. Patrick",
    feast_day: "03-17",
    short_bio: "Apostle of Ireland and patron saint of Ireland",
    biography: [
      "St. Patrick was born in Roman Britain in the late 4th century, around 385 AD. At the age of 16, he was captured by Irish raiders and taken to Ireland as a slave, where he worked as a shepherd for six years.",
      "During his captivity, Patrick turned to God in prayer. He later wrote that he prayed many times a day, and his faith grew stronger. After six years, he heard a voice telling him that he would soon go home and that a ship was ready for him. He escaped, traveled about 200 miles to a port, and found a ship that took him back to Britain.",
      "After returning home, Patrick had a vision in which he received a letter titled 'The Voice of the Irish.' In the vision, he heard the Irish people calling him to come back and walk among them. This inspired him to study for the priesthood, and he was eventually ordained a bishop.",
      "Around 432 AD, Patrick returned to Ireland as a missionary. Despite facing opposition from local druids and pagan leaders, he successfully converted thousands to Christianity. He used the shamrock, a three-leaved plant, to explain the concept of the Holy Trinity.",
      "Patrick established churches, monasteries, and schools throughout Ireland, laying the foundation for the strong Christian tradition that would later earn Ireland the title 'Island of Saints and Scholars.' His missionary work continued for nearly 30 years.",
      "He died on March 17, 461 AD, which is now celebrated as St. Patrick's Day. His spiritual autobiography, the 'Confession,' provides much of what we know about his life and mission. He is venerated as the primary patron saint of Ireland.",
