      "St. John Macias was born in Ribera del Fresno, Spain, in 1585. Orphaned at a young age, he was raised by an uncle who employed him as a shepherd. During his long hours in the fields, John developed a deep prayer life and devotion to the rosary.",
      "At the age of 25, feeling called to serve God in the New World, John traveled to Lima, Peru. After working for several years on a large cattle ranch outside the city, he joined the Dominican Order as a lay brother in 1622, at the age of 37.",
      "John was assigned to be the porter (doorkeeper) at the Dominican Priory of St. Mary Magdalene in Lima, a position he held for over 20 years. As porter, he was responsible for distributing food and alms to the poor who came to the monastery door.",
      "He became known for his extraordinary charity, often miraculously multiplying food to feed more people. It is said that he fed over 200 poor people each day. He also had a special ministry to the souls in purgatory, offering many prayers and penances for their release.",
      "John was a close friend of St. Martin de Porres, another Dominican lay brother in Lima. The two saints shared a deep spirituality and commitment to serving the poor, though John was known to be more contemplative while Martin was more active in his service.",
      "He died on September 16, 1645, after a long illness. He was canonized by Pope Paul VI on September 28, 1975, together with his fellow Peruvian Dominican, St. Martin de Porres.",

He is called 'Angelico' (angelic) because of the spiritual quality of his art and his own holy character. He lived at the reformed Dominican convent of San Domenico in Fiesole and later at San Marco in Florence.",
      "Fra Angelico combined his artistic gifts with his Dominican vocation, creating sacred art that served the purposes of prayer and contemplation. He painted numerous frescoes in the cells and corridors of San Marco, providing his brother friars with images for meditation. His most famous works include the Annunciation fresco at San Marco and the frescoes in the Chapel of Nicholas V at the Vatican.",
      "His art was characterized by its spiritual depth, serenity, and theological insight. He would pray before beginning each work and reportedly wept when painting scenes of the Crucifixion. He saw his art not as self-expression but as a form of preaching—making visible the mysteries of faith.",
      "Fra Angelico served as prior of San Domenico in Fiesole and later worked in Rome at the request of Pope Eugene IV and his successors. He declined the offer to become Archbishop of Florence, preferring to remain a simple friar dedicated to his art and prayer.",

His reputation for holiness was immediate, and he has been called 'Beato Angelico' (Blessed Angelic One) since shortly after his death.

    biography: [
      "St. Francis Fernandez de Capillas was born in 1607 in Palencia, Spain. He entered the Dominican Order in Valladolid and was ordained a priest. Filled with missionary zeal, he volunteered for the China missions and traveled to the Philippines, where he studied the Chinese language and culture to prepare for his work.",
      "In 1642, Francis arrived in the Fujian province of China, where he ministered courageously despite the persecution of Christians. He preached the Gospel, administered the sacraments, and cared for the Christian communities suffering under persecution. He worked particularly among the poor and marginalized, often in dangerous circumstances.",
      "In 1648, during the Manchu conquest of China, Francis was arrested along with other Christians. He was imprisoned and subjected to torture to force him to renounce his faith. Despite severe beatings and the witnessing of other Christians being martyred, Francis remained steadfast in his faith and continued to encourage his fellow prisoners.",
      "On January 15, 1648, Francis was beheaded in Fogan, Fujian province, becoming the first Dominican martyr in China and the protomartyr (first martyr) of the entire Chinese mission. Before his execution, he forgave his persecutors and prayed for the conversion of China.",
      "St. Peter Sans i Jordà was born on September 23, 1680, in Ascó, Catalonia, Spain. He joined the Dominicans and was sent to the Philippines, then to China as a missionary bishop. He served as Vicar Apostolic of Fujian, leading the Dominican missions in China with great pastoral care.",
      "In 1747, during the persecution under Emperor Qianlong, Bishop Peter Sans and several Dominican missionaries and Chinese Christians were arrested. They were imprisoned in Fuzhou and subjected to interrogation and torture. Peter encouraged his companions in faith, celebrating Mass secretly in prison and preparing them for martyrdom.",
      "On May 26, 1747, Bishop Peter Sans, along with four Dominican priests (Joachim Royo, John Alcober, Francis Serrano, and Francis Díaz), one Chinese Dominican priest (Francis Chieu), and four Chinese laymen, were martyred by strangulation in Fuzhou. Their constancy in faith and their forgiveness of their persecutors made a profound impression even on their executioners.",
      "These martyrs, along with others who died for the faith in China, were beatified by Pope Leo XIII in 1893 and canonized by Pope John Paul II on October 1, 2000, as part of the group of 120 Martyrs of China. Their feast is celebrated in the Dominican calendar on January 15, honoring their witness to Christ and their missionary dedication.",

      "The emperor ordered Catherine to be tortured on a spiked wheel (later known as the Catherine Wheel). According to tradition, the wheel broke miraculously when she touched it, killing some of the spectators. The Empress Faustina and the commander Porphyrius visited Catherine in prison and were converted by her witness; both were subsequently martyred.",
      "Finally, Catherine was beheaded around 305 AD. According to legend, instead of blood, milk flowed from her wounds. Angels are said to have carried her body to Mount Sinai, where centuries later, monks discovered her incorrupt relics. The famous Monastery of St. Catherine at Mount Sinai, built by Emperor Justinian in the 6th century, houses what are believed to be her relics.",
      "St. Catherine is one of the Fourteen Holy Helpers, a group of saints venerated together in medieval Christianity for their powerful intercession. Her feast was celebrated widely in the Middle Ages, and she became the patron saint of philosophers, scholars, students, and young unmarried women. Joan of Arc claimed Catherine as one of the saints who spoke to her.",
      "While removed from the general Roman calendar in 1969 due to questions about historical documentation, her veneration has continued, particularly in the Eastern Orthodox Church and among various religious orders. Her feast was restored as an optional memorial in some regions. The Dominican Order has maintained her commemoration in its proper calendar, reflecting the Order's scholarly tradition and devotion to learned saints.",

      "St. Maria-Alphonsina Danil Ghattas was born on October 4, 1843, in Jerusalem to a Palestinian Catholic family of Greek Melkite rite. Her baptismal name was Soultaneh ('little queen' in Arabic). She was educated at the school of the Sisters of St. Joseph of the Apparition in Jerusalem.",
      "In 1858, at age 15, she joined the Sisters of St. Joseph and took the name Sister Mary Alphonsine. She devoted herself to teaching and serving the poor in various locations in Palestine, including Bethlehem, Beit Jala, Salt (in present-day Jordan), and Nazareth.",
      "Moved by the difficult living conditions of young Arab women and inspired by Dominican spirituality, Sister Mary Alphonsine, along with Father Joseph Tannous, founded the Congregation of the Most Holy Rosary (Sisters of the Rosary) in 1880 in Jerusalem. This was the first indigenous Palestinian religious congregation.",
      "As foundress, she established schools and centers to educate young Arab women and provide them with skills and opportunities. The congregation grew to serve throughout Palestine and neighboring regions, focusing on education and social services for marginalized communities.",
      "Mother Mary Alphonsine led the congregation with wisdom and deep faith until her death on March 25, 1927, in Ein Karem, near Jerusalem. She was buried in the congregation's motherhouse in Ein Karem.",
      "She was beatified by Pope John Paul II in 2009 and canonized by Pope Francis on May 17, 2015, becoming one of the first Palestinian saints. Her congregation continues its mission of education and service in the Middle East and beyond.",
