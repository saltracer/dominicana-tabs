    biography: [
      "Blessed Raymond of Capua was born around 1330 in Capua, Italy, to the noble della Vigna family. He received an excellent education, studying law at the University of Bologna before joining the Dominican Order around 1350.",
      "After his ordination, Raymond served in various leadership positions within the Order. In 1374, he was appointed as the spiritual director and confessor of St. Catherine of Siena, a role that would profoundly shape both their lives.",
      "Raymond became Catherine's closest advisor and confidant, supporting her in her public ministry and diplomatic missions. After her death in 1380, he wrote her biography, 'The Life of St. Catherine of Siena,' which remains an important source for understanding her life and spirituality.",
      "In 1380, Raymond was elected Master General of the Dominican Order. He faced the enormous challenge of reforming the Order, which had been severely affected by the Black Death and the Western Schism. He implemented a program of gradual reform, focusing on restoring regular observance and spiritual discipline.",
      "Despite resistance, Raymond's reforms took root and eventually led to a significant renewal of Dominican life. He traveled extensively throughout Europe, visiting Dominican houses and encouraging the friars to return to the original spirit of the Order.",
      "Raymond died on October 5, 1399, in Nuremberg, Germany, while on a visitation of Dominican houses. He was beatified by Pope Leo XIII in 1899. His feast day is celebrated on October 5, particularly within the Dominican Order.",

    biography: [
      "St. Louis-Marie Grignion de Montfort was born on January 31, 1673, in Montfort-sur-Meu, Brittany, France. From an early age, he displayed a deep devotion to the Blessed Virgin Mary, a characteristic that would define his entire life and ministry.",
      "After his ordination to the priesthood in 1700, Louis-Marie worked as a hospital chaplain in Poitiers. Dissatisfied with the spiritual tepidity he encountered, he began to develop his distinctive approach to evangelization through popular missions in parishes throughout western France.",
      "Louis-Marie joined the Third Order of St. Dominic, embracing Dominican spirituality while maintaining his unique apostolate. His preaching was characterized by a strong emphasis on Marian devotion, particularly through the Rosary, and a call to renewal of baptismal promises.",
      "In 1705, he wrote his most famous work, 'True Devotion to Mary,' which outlines his approach to Marian consecration. The manuscript was lost for over a century before being rediscovered in 1842. His spiritual teaching, often summarized as 'To Jesus through Mary,' has influenced countless Catholics, including Pope John Paul II.",
      "In 1713, Louis-Marie founded two religious congregations: the Daughters of Wisdom, dedicated to hospital work and education of poor girls, and the Company of Mary (Montfort Fathers), devoted to preaching missions.",
      "Worn out by his missionary labors, Louis-Marie died on April 28, 1716, at the age of 43. He was canonized by Pope Pius XII in 1947. His influence continues through his writings and the religious communities he founded.",
