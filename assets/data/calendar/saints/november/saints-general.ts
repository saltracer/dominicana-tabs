    name: "St. Elizabeth of the Trinity",
    feast_day: "11-08",
    short_bio: "French Carmelite nun, mystic, and spiritual writer",
    biography: [
      "Elizabeth Catez was born on July 18, 1880, in the military camp of Avor, near Bourges, France, to a military family. From an early age, she displayed a strong will and passionate nature, which she gradually learned to direct toward God. A gifted pianist, she won several awards for her musical talent.",
      "At age seven, after the death of her father, the family moved to Dijon, where Elizabeth would spend most of her life. Despite her lively temperament, she experienced profound mystical graces from an early age, including a deep awareness of God's presence. At her First Communion in 1891, she experienced an intense union with Christ that marked the beginning of her spiritual journey.",
      "Though she felt called to religious life from an early age, Elizabeth had to wait until she was 21 to enter the Carmel of Dijon due to her mother's opposition. During these years of waiting, she lived an active social life while maintaining a deep interior life, offering her sufferings for the conversion of sinners and the sanctification of priests.",
      "She finally entered the Carmelite monastery on August 2, 1901, taking the name Sister Elizabeth of the Trinity. Her time in Carmel was marked by intense spiritual growth, profound prayer, and suffering from Addison's disease, which would eventually lead to her death at the young age of 26.",
      "Elizabeth's spiritual writings, particularly her letters and retreats, reveal her profound understanding of the indwelling of the Trinity in the soul. She developed a spirituality centered on being a 'praise of glory' to God, living in constant awareness of the divine presence within.",
      "During her final illness, she wrote her famous 'Elevation to the Trinity' and 'Last Retreat,' which have become spiritual classics. She died on November 9, 1906, and was canonized by Pope Francis on October 16, 2016. Her feast day is celebrated on November 8, the date of her religious profession.",

      "I think that in heaven my mission will be to draw souls by helping them to go out of themselves in order to cling to God by a wholly simple and loving movement, and to keep them in this great silence within which will allow God to communicate Himself to them and to transform them into Himself.",

    prayers: `
      O my God, Trinity whom I adore, help me to forget myself entirely so to establish myself in you, unmovable and peaceful as if my soul were already in eternity. May nothing trouble my peace or make me leave you, O my Unchanging One, but may each minute carry me further into the depths of your mystery. Give peace to my soul; make it your heaven, your beloved dwelling and the place of your rest. May I never leave you there alone but be wholly present, my faith completely attentive, wholly adoring, and fully surrendered to your creative action.
  
      O my beloved Christ, crucified by love, I wish to be a bride for your Heart; I wish to cover you with glory; I wish to love you...until I die of love! But I feel my weakness, and I ask you to clothe me with yourself; identify my soul with all the movements of your soul, submerge me, overwhelm me, substitute yourself for me, that my life may be but a radiance of your life. Come into me as Adorer, as Restorer, as Savior.
  
      O Eternal Word, Word of my God, I want to spend my life listening to you, to become wholly teachable so that I may learn all from you. Then, through all nights, all voids, all powerlessness, I want to fixate on you always and remain under your great light. O my beloved Star, so fascinate me that I may never withdraw from your radiance.

    id: "cecilia",
    name: "St. Cecilia",
    feast_day: "11-22",
    short_bio: "Virgin martyr and patroness of musicians",
    biography: [
      "St. Cecilia was born to a noble Roman family in the early 3rd century. According to tradition, she was a devout Christian from an early age, despite living during a time of persecution. She is said to have heard heavenly music in her heart, which led to her association with music and musicians.",
      "Though she had consecrated her virginity to God, Cecilia's parents arranged for her to marry a young pagan nobleman named Valerian. On their wedding night, she told Valerian that an angel watched over her and would protect her virginity. Valerian asked to see this angel and Cecilia told him he would be able to if he was baptized.",
      "Valerian sought out Pope Urban I, who was hiding in the catacombs, and was instructed and baptized. When he returned to Cecilia, he found her praying in her room with an angel beside her. The angel crowned Cecilia with a wreath of roses and lilies. Valerian's brother, Tiburtius, was also converted after witnessing this miracle.",
      "The brothers began to bury the bodies of martyred Christians, which was forbidden by Roman law. They were arrested and brought before the prefect Turcius Almachius. When they refused to sacrifice to the Roman gods, they were executed. Cecilia buried their bodies and was soon arrested herself for her Christian faith.",
      "Almachius ordered Cecilia to be suffocated in the baths of her own home. When this failed to kill her, an executioner was sent to behead her. The executioner struck her neck three times (the maximum allowed by Roman law) but failed to sever her head completely. Cecilia lived for three more days, during which time she gave away her possessions to the poor and converted many who came to visit her.",
      "She died around 230 AD and was buried in the Catacomb of Callixtus. In 821, her body was transferred to the Church of St. Cecilia in Trastevere, Rome. When her tomb was opened in 1599, her body was found incorrupt, appearing as if she had just died. The sculptor Stefano Maderno created a famous statue depicting her exactly as she was found.",
      "St. Cecilia is one of the most venerated martyrs of Christian antiquity and is mentioned in the Roman Canon of the Mass. Her feast day has been celebrated since the 4th century. She became the patroness of musicians and music in the Middle Ages, and many musical societies and conservatories around the world bear her name.",
      "Artistic depictions of St. Cecilia typically show her playing an organ or other musical instrument, often with an angel nearby. Her story has inspired countless works of art, music, and literature throughout the centuries, including Handel's 'Ode for St. Cecilia's Day' and Raphael's famous painting of the saint.",
