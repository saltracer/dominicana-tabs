    <verse number="1" style="v" sid="2CO 1:1" />Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy our brother: to the church of God that is at Corinth, with all the saints that are in all Achaia: <verse eid="2CO 1:1" /><verse number="2" style="v" sid="2CO 1:2" />Grace unto you and peace from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ. <verse eid="2CO 1:2" /><verse number="3" style="v" sid="2CO 1:3" />Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort. <verse eid="2CO 1:3" /><verse number="4" style="v" sid="2CO 1:4" />Who comforteth us in all our tribulation; that we also may be able to comfort them who are in all distress, by the exhortation wherewith we also are exhorted by God. <verse eid="2CO 1:4" /><verse number="5" style="v" sid="2CO 1:5" />For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us: so also by Christ doth our comfort abound. <verse eid="2CO 1:5" /><verse number="6" style="v" sid="2CO 1:6" />Now whether we be in tribulation, it is for your exhortation and salvation: or whether we be comforted, it is for your consolation: or whether we be exhorted, it is for your exhortation and salvation, which worketh the enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer. <verse eid="2CO 1:6" /><verse number="7" style="v" sid="2CO 1:7" />That our hope for you may be steadfast: knowing that as you are partakers of the sufferings, so shall you be also of the consolation. <verse eid="2CO 1:7" /><verse number="8" style="v" sid="2CO 1:8" />For we would not have you ignorant, brethren, of our tribulation, which came to us in Asia, that we were pressed out of measure above our strength, so that we were weary even of life. <verse eid="2CO 1:8" /><verse number="9" style="v" sid="2CO 1:9" />But we had in ourselves the answer of death, that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God who raiseth the dead. <verse eid="2CO 1:9" /><verse number="10" style="v" sid="2CO 1:10" />Who hath delivered and doth deliver us out of so great dangers: in whom we trust that he will yet also deliver us. <verse eid="2CO 1:10" /><verse number="11" style="v" sid="2CO 1:11" />You helping withal in prayer for us: that for this gift obtained for us, by the means of many persons, thanks may be given by many in our behalf. <verse eid="2CO 1:11" /><verse number="12" style="v" sid="2CO 1:12" />For our glory is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity of heart and sincerity of God, and not in carnal wisdom, but in the grace of God, we have conversed in this world: and more abundantly towards you. <verse eid="2CO 1:12" /><verse number="13" style="v" sid="2CO 1:13" />For we write no other things to you than what you have read and known. And I hope that you shall know unto the end: <verse eid="2CO 1:13" /><verse number="14" style="v" sid="2CO 1:14" />As also you have known us in part, that we are your glory, as you also are ours, in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ. <verse eid="2CO 1:14" /><verse number="15" style="v" sid="2CO 1:15" />And in this confidence I had a mind to come to you before, that you might have a second grace: <verse eid="2CO 1:15" /><verse number="16" style="v" sid="2CO 1:16" />And to pass by you into Macedonia, and again from Macedonia to come to you, and by you to be brought on my way towards Judea. <verse eid="2CO 1:16" /><verse number="17" style="v" sid="2CO 1:17" />Whereas then I was thus minded, did I use lightness? Or, the things that I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh, that there should be with me, It is, and It is not? <verse eid="2CO 1:17" /><verse number="18" style="v" sid="2CO 1:18" />But God is faithful, for our preaching which was to you, was not, It is, and It is not. <verse eid="2CO 1:18" /><verse number="19" style="v" sid="2CO 1:19" />For the Son of God, Jesus Christ who was preached among you by us, by me, and Sylvanus, and Timothy, was not, It is and It is not, but, It is, was in him. <verse eid="2CO 1:19" /><verse number="20" style="v" sid="2CO 1:20" />For all the promises of God are in him, It is; therefore also by him, amen to God, unto our glory. <verse eid="2CO 1:20" /><verse number="21" style="v" sid="2CO 1:21" />Now he that confirmeth us with you in Christ, and that hath anointed us, is God: <verse eid="2CO 1:21" /><verse number="22" style="v" sid="2CO 1:22" />Who also hath sealed us, and given the pledge of the Spirit in our hearts. <verse eid="2CO 1:22" /><verse number="23" style="v" sid="2CO 1:23" />But I call God to witness upon my soul, that to spare you, I came not any more to Corinth: <verse eid="2CO 1:23" /><verse number="24" style="v" sid="2CO 1:24" />not because we exercise dominion over your faith: but we are helpers of your joy: for in faith you stand.<verse eid="2CO 1:24" /></para>

For, what I have pardoned, if I have pardoned any thing, for your sakes have I done it in the person of Christ. <verse eid="2CO 2:10" /><verse number="11" style="v" sid="2CO 2:11" />That we be not overreached by Satan. For we are not ignorant of his devices. <verse eid="2CO 2:11" /><verse number="12" style="v" sid="2CO 2:12" />And when I was come to Troas for the gospel of Christ, and a door was opened unto me in the Lord, <verse eid="2CO 2:12" /><verse number="13" style="v" sid="2CO 2:13" />I had no rest in my spirit, because I found not Titus my brother; but bidding them farewell, I went into Macedonia. <verse eid="2CO 2:13" /><verse number="14" style="v" sid="2CO 2:14" />Now thanks be to God, who always maketh us to triumph in Christ Jesus, and manifesteth the odour of his knowledge by us in every place. <verse eid="2CO 2:14" /><verse number="15" style="v" sid="2CO 2:15" />For we are the good odour of Christ unto God, in them that are saved, and in them that perish. <verse eid="2CO 2:15" /><verse number="16" style="v" sid="2CO 2:16" />To the one indeed the odour of death unto death: but to the others the odour of life unto life. And for these things who is so sufficient? <verse eid="2CO 2:16" /><verse number="17" style="v" sid="2CO 2:17" />For we are not as many, adulterating the word of God; but with sincerity, but as from God, before God, in Christ we speak.<verse eid="2CO 2:17" /></para>

Or do we need (as some do) epistles of commendation to you, or from you? <verse eid="2CO 3:1" /><verse number="2" style="v" sid="2CO 3:2" />You are our epistle, written in our hearts, which is known and read by all men: <verse eid="2CO 3:2" /><verse number="3" style="v" sid="2CO 3:3" />Being manifested, that you are the epistle of Christ, ministered by us, and written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in the fleshly tables of the heart. <verse eid="2CO 3:3" /><verse number="4" style="v" sid="2CO 3:4" />And such confidence we have, through Christ, towards God. <verse eid="2CO 3:4" /><verse number="5" style="v" sid="2CO 3:5" />Not that we are sufficient to think any thing of ourselves, as of ourselves: but our sufficiency is from God. <verse eid="2CO 3:5" /><verse number="6" style="v" sid="2CO 3:6" />Who also hath made us fit ministers of the new testament, not in the letter, but in the spirit. For the letter killeth, but the spirit quickeneth. <verse eid="2CO 3:6" /><verse number="7" style="v" sid="2CO 3:7" />Now if the ministration of death, engraven with letters upon stones, was glorious; so that the children of Israel could not steadfastly behold the face of Moses, for the glory of his countenance, which is made void: <verse eid="2CO 3:7" /><verse number="8" style="v" sid="2CO 3:8" />How shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather in glory? <verse eid="2CO 3:8" /><verse number="9" style="v" sid="2CO 3:9" />For if the ministration of condemnation be glory, much more the ministration of justice aboundeth in glory. <verse eid="2CO 3:9" /><verse number="10" style="v" sid="2CO 3:10" />For even that which was glorious in this part was not glorified, by reason of the glory that excelleth. <verse eid="2CO 3:10" /><verse number="11" style="v" sid="2CO 3:11" />For if that which is done away was glorious, much more that which remaineth is in glory. <verse eid="2CO 3:11" /><verse number="12" style="v" sid="2CO 3:12" />Having therefore such hope, we use much confidence: <verse eid="2CO 3:12" /><verse number="13" style="v" sid="2CO 3:13" />And not as Moses put a veil upon his face, that the children of Israel might not steadfastly look on the face of that which is made void. <verse eid="2CO 3:13" /><verse number="14" style="v" sid="2CO 3:14" />But their senses were made dull. For, until this present day, the selfsame veil, in the reading of the old testament, remaineth not taken away (because in Christ it is made void). <verse eid="2CO 3:14" /><verse number="15" style="v" sid="2CO 3:15" />But even until this day, when Moses is read, the veil is upon their heart. <verse eid="2CO 3:15" /><verse number="16" style="v" sid="2CO 3:16" />But when they shall be converted to the Lord, the veil shall be taken away. <verse eid="2CO 3:16" /><verse number="17" style="v" sid="2CO 3:17" />Now the Lord is a Spirit. And where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty. <verse eid="2CO 3:17" /><verse number="18" style="v" sid="2CO 3:18" />But we all beholding the glory of the Lord with open face, are transformed into the same image from glory to glory, as by the Spirit of the Lord.<verse eid="2CO 3:18" /></para>

    <verse number="1" style="v" sid="2CO 13:1" />Behold, this is the third time I am coming to you: In the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word stand. <verse eid="2CO 13:1" /><verse number="2" style="v" sid="2CO 13:2" />I have told before, and foretell, as present, and now absent, to them that sinned before, and to all the rest, that if I come again, I will not spare. <verse eid="2CO 13:2" /><verse number="3" style="v" sid="2CO 13:3" />Do you seek a proof of Christ that speaketh in me, who towards you is not weak, but is mighty in you? <verse eid="2CO 13:3" /><verse number="4" style="v" sid="2CO 13:4" />For although he was crucified through weakness, yet he liveth by the power of God. For we also are weak in him: but we shall live with him by the power of God towards you. <verse eid="2CO 13:4" /><verse number="5" style="v" sid="2CO 13:5" />Try your own selves if you be in the faith; prove ye yourselves. Know you not your own selves, that Christ Jesus is in you, unless perhaps you be reprobates? <verse eid="2CO 13:5" /><verse number="6" style="v" sid="2CO 13:6" />But I trust that you shall know that we are not reprobates. <verse eid="2CO 13:6" /><verse number="7" style="v" sid="2CO 13:7" />Now we pray God, that you may do no evil, not that we may appear approved, but that you may do that which is good, and that we may be as reprobates. <verse eid="2CO 13:7" /><verse number="8" style="v" sid="2CO 13:8" />For we can do nothing against the truth; but for the truth. <verse eid="2CO 13:8" /><verse number="9" style="v" sid="2CO 13:9" />For we rejoice that we are weak, and you are strong. This also we pray for, your perfection. <verse eid="2CO 13:9" /><verse number="10" style="v" sid="2CO 13:10" />Therefore I write these things, being absent, that, being present, I may not deal more severely, according to the power which the Lord hath given me unto edification, and not unto destruction. <verse eid="2CO 13:10" /><verse number="11" style="v" sid="2CO 13:11" />For the rest, brethren, rejoice, be perfect, take exhortation, be of one mind, have peace; and the God of peace and of love shall be with you. <verse eid="2CO 13:11" /><verse number="12" style="v" sid="2CO 13:12" />Salute one another with a holy kiss. All the saints salute you. <verse eid="2CO 13:12" /><verse number="13" style="v" sid="2CO 13:13" />The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the charity of God, and the communication of the Holy Ghost be with you all. Amen.<verse eid="2CO 13:13" /></para>
